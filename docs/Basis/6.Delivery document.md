# Upload a delivery document

The endpoint to add a document uses the multipart/form-data format, which allows files to be sent together with the classic form data.

Firstly, it is crucial to send the header of the **Content-Type** : `multipart/form-data; boundary=<calculated>` the boundary is calculated by the browser or the HTTP library used.

Each part of the form is sent as follows:

- For files

```json
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="{NAME}"; filename="{FILE NAME}"[CRLF]
Content-Type: {MIME TYPE}[CRLF]
[CRLF]
{CONTENT}

```

- For classic data

```json
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="{NAME}"[CRLF]
[CRLF]
{VALUE}
```

The [CRLF] is equivalent to a line break "\r\n". The LAST NAME and FILE NAME must not contain quotation marks (") or a line break (\r or \n).

The data is separated by the boundary.
