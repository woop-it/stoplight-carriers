# Subscriptions

The subscription system allows you to **subscribe to requests and events related to** orders placed on the Woop platform.

For example: Request for a quote, request for a delivery, change of delivery status, etc.

These requests and events are described in the **Woop to Carrier** documentation.

## Initiating subscriptions

To subscribe to requests and events a first call to **the API [/subscriptions](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/carrier_to_woop.json/paths/~1subscriptions/post)** is required.

## Callbacks

`Callbacks` also called `webhooks` allow you to define the URL called for each request or event, various callbacks are available:

| Callback       | Description                                       | Interface contract                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| quote          | Callback to receive quote requests                | [/quotes](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1quotes/post)                                                    |
| delivery       | Callback to receive delivery requests             | [/deliveries](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1deliveries/post)                                            |
| cancelDelivery | Callback to receive requests to cancel a delivery | [/deliveries/{deliveryId}](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1deliveries~1%7BdeliveryId%7D/delete)           |
| cancelQuote    | Callback to receive requests to cancel a quote    | [/quotes/{quoteId}](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1quotes~1%7BquoteId%7D/delete)                         |
| score          | Callback to receive customer ratings              | [/deliveries/{deliveryId}/score](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1deliveries~1%7BdeliveryId%7D~1score/put) |
| pickupPoint    | Callback to receive relay point requests          | [/pickupPoints](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1pickupPoints/get)                                         |
| label          | Callback to receive label requests                | [/labels/{labelId}](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1labels~1{labelId}/get)                                |
| pinCodes          | Callback to receive the booking pinCode for a pickup point               | [/deliveries/{deliveryId}/pinCodes](woop_to_carrier.json/paths/~1deliveries~1{deliveryId}~1pinCodes)                                |

**URL**

URL of the API route where the Woop platform will send the callback event.

<!-- theme: info -->

> **URL variables**
>
> To retrieve the deliveryId or quoteId in your APIs, it is highly recommended to include the variables `{deliveryId}` and `{quoteId}` in your callback URLs.
> These variables will be replaced by the real values during the calls.
>
> Exemple: **https://my_url/deliveries/{deliveryId}**

**Version**

Targeted API version of the callback.

Like all our APIs, callbacks are versioned, **when you subscribe to a callback you must specify which version**.

The version is found in the documentation [Woop to Carrier](https://woop.stoplight.io/docs/carrier/woop_to_carrier.json).

Example:

```json
{
  "callbacks": {
    "status": {
      "url": "https://my_url/quotes",
      "version": "1.6.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Headers

If your API needs additional HTTP headers, you can add multiple key-value pairs to be sent on each call.

When `headers` is on top-level in body, they are sent for each callback:

Example:

```json
{
  "callback": {
    ...
  },
  "headers" : [
    {
      "x-api-key": "78YJHBG738knkh3"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also add headers for a specific callback. The headers are sent only for this callback.

Example:

```json
{
  "callback": {
    "quote": {
      "url": "https://my-quote.com",
      "headers": [
        {
          "x-api-key": "ABCDEFG"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- theme: info -->

> When `headers` are defined both on top-level and specific callback level, `headers` sent are **specific callback level**, top-level `headers` are ignored.

### Auth

Your API can be configured if it requires authentication.

Three authentication methods are available:

<!--
type: tab
title: Basic method
-->

Configuration:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "basic": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "1234"
    }
  }
}
```

An HTTP header `Authorisation: Basic YWRtaW46MTIzNA==` will be sent to your API.

`YWRtaW46MTIzNA==` Which is the Base64 representation of the text admin:1234

<!--
type: tab
title: OAuth2 method
-->

Configuration:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "oauth2": {
      "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
      "client_secret": "xxxxxxXXXXXXx",
      "audience": "my-audience.fr",
      "grant_type": "client_credentials",
      "tokenEndPoint": "https://my-token-url.fr"
    }
  }
}
```

A token exchange that complies with the [OAuth2 client_credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) will be made for each call.

<!--
type: tab
title: Token method
-->

Configuration:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "token": {
      "token": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "1234",
      "endpoint": "https://my-token-url.fr"
    }
  }
}
```

This method will make a call **HTTP POST** to the configured endpoint with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "username": "{username}",
  "password": "{password}"
}
```

The called endpoint should return a token:

```json
{
  "token": "87YB1K2B312K3"
}
```

This token will be sent in the HTTP header `Authorisation: Bearer {token}`

<!-- type: tab-end -->

<!-- theme: info -->

> Like `headers`, `auth` can be declared on top-level or in specific callback. When `auth` are defined both on top-level and specific callback level, `auth` used are those of **specific callback level**, top-level `auth` are ignored.

### Example subscriptions

<!--
type: tab
title: Example 1
-->

I subscribe to the required subscriptions, my API is protected by a simple API Key.

```json
{
  "callbacks": {
    "quote": {
      "url": "https://my_url/quotes",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "delivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "cancelDelivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries/{deliveryId}",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "x-api-key": "514541VVNB"
    }
  ]
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: Example 2
-->

I subscribe to the required subscriptions, my API is protected by authentication, it is possible to configure it OAuth2.

```json
{
  "callbacks": {
    "quote": {
      "url": "https://my_url/quotes",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "delivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "cancelDelivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries/{deliveryId}",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "cancelQuote": {
      "url": "https://my_url/quotes/{quoteId}",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "score": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries/{deliveryId}/score",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "pickupPoint": {
      "url": "https://my_url/pickupPoints",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "oauth2": {
      "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
      "client_secret": "xxxxxxXXXXXXx",
      "audience": "my-audience.fr",
      "grant_type": "client_credentials",
      "tokenEndPoint": "https://my-token-url.fr"
    }
  }
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: Exemple 3
-->

I subscribe to some subscriptions, my API is protected by OAuth2, but `quote` callback requires a different authentication (oauth is not used for `quote` callback).

```json
{
  "callbacks": {
    "quote": {
      "url": "https://my_partener/quotes",
      "version": "1.5.0",
      "auth": {
        "basic": {
          "username": "admin",
          "password": "1234"
        }
      }
    },
    "delivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "cancelDelivery": {
      "url": "https://my_url/deliveries/{deliveryId}",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "oauth2": {
      "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
      "client_secret": "xxxxxxXXXXXXx",
      "audience": "my-audience.fr",
      "grant_type": "client_credentials",
      "tokenEndPoint": "https://my-token-url.fr"
    }
  }
}
```

> **HTTP methods and codes**

> When implementing interface contracts, it is **important** to use **HTTP methods** (POST. PATCH etc.) and the **HTTP return codes** (201, 400 etc.) specified in the interface contract.
