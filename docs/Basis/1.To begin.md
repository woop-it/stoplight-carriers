# To begin

To begin, all technical information about Woop APIs for carriers is contained in this documentation. For any questions or clarifications, please contact the internal technical team.

To use the APIs, you will need the login information you received when you created your account on the platform.


This document is divided into 2 sections illustrating the exchanges possible between Woop and the Carrier:

- `Carrier to Woop` Which describes the overall operation of the APIs (response) from the carrier to Woop. Functions such as updating delivery status and adding billing information are described in this section.
- `Woop to Carrier` Which generally describes how Woop's creation APIs work when sent to the carrier. This section describes functions such as creating a (delivery order) and retrieving a list of relay points.
