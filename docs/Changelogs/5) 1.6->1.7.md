#### Adding barcode, type and attributes to "package" model

- In `POST /quotes`, `POST /deliveries`, the node `references` evolves to include a `barcode` for each package involved

<!-- type: tab-end -->
- Section `attributes` of `package` added including `footprint` (package footprint on the ground), expressed in m², cm² or pallet
- `type` of a `package` added
- `product.type` TYPOLOGY_PALLET_GENERIC has been deleted. Instead, you will receive `package.type` as PALLET and `product.type` as TYPOLOGY_GENERIC instead

#### Adding stops to POST /quotes et POST /deliveries/
If the retailer has already set up routes and stops for a delivery, a `stop` section has been added to `POST /quotes` and `POST /deliveries` to enable the carrier to collect these data.


#### PATCH /deliveries/{deliveryId} deprecated
`PATCH /deliveries/{deliveryId}` is now deprecated. When a delivery requires an update, it will be first deleted using `DELETE /deliveries/{deliveryId}` and then recreacted using `POST /deliveries`.
What is more, the `POST /subscriptions` API has been updated to remove the `update` callback.


### Carrier to Woop
#### PUT /deliveries/{deliveryId}/stops

Creation of this API enabling a carrier to update the picking or delivery stops of a specific delivery, including for each stop :

- `references.id`: id of the stop
- `sequenceNumber`: stop sequence number between all stops from one route (starting from 1)
- `stop.route.references.id`: id of the route
- `stop.route.sequenceNumber`: route sequence number between all routes from one planning (starting from 1)
- `stop.route.vehicle`: vehicle that will be used
- `stop.route.team` : list of member Ids performing the route
- `stop.route.planning.references.id`: id of the planning
